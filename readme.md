#Suit-baze
Suit-baze is a Front-end starter kit base on [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate) modified by developers from [Suitmedia](https://github.com/Suitmedia).

##About this branch

It is an experimental branch called **single-script**. Everything is the same from the **master** except here all 3rd party scripts (even jQuery) are loaded asynchronously using [modernizr](http://modernizr.com/).

To see how it works, check out the [main.js](https://github.com/ImBobby/suit-baze/blob/single-script/dev/js/main.js).

##Purpose

Asynchronously load all 3rd party scripts will reduce http request.
